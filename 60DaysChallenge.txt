Day 9:
Progress:Tweaking my envs with small database project. Working with my forked repo of PySyft. Lesson 5 continued.
Thoughts: Still need to update my resume.
Links:

Day 10
Progress: Lesson 5 which at some point I already completed. 
Thoughts: Need to get through to some new material. Probably should've taken a skip day.
Links:

Day 11:
Progress: Finished Lesson 5
Thoughts: Grateful
Links:

Day 12:
Progress: Installing nbextensions to jupyter notebook. 
Thoughts: Create value for society and business through your projects. 
Links:

Day 13: 
Progress: Had to share my laptop. Reviewed Lessons 5.16-22.
Thoughts: So much to learn.

Day 14: Remembered why I don't go to the mall on weekends. :christmas_tree:
Review of Lesson 5.17-22. Trying a couple of things to get my data to load in jupyter notebooks. 
Possibly firewall protection preventing access. Unicode error.

Day 15: Getting dataset from kaggle. Will work on Cat vs Dog data in kaggle as suggested. 
Links: Watched Live Debate Yoshua Bengio vs. Gary Marcus https://www.facebook.com/MontrealAI/videos/498403850881660/

Day 16: Watched Kaggle GrandMaster Panel. It's Christmas Eve.
Links: https://youtu.be/BNAiHpH_gMM

Day 17: Christmas was a skip day! Started Lesson 6 today. Completed Lesson 6.1-6.10
Thoughts: Trained model with 10 epochs then 30 epochs. Tested once with 98% accuracy!

Day 18: Validation step on yesterdays network. Test loss was less. 
	Still 98% overall test accuracy with each classification accuracy now higher.
	Lesson 6.13-6.23 Learning CNNs. Padding with black pixels might be problematic. 
Thoughts: Adding anything to an image doesn't seem safe. There has to be a better way to handle edges - maybe don't. Leave them shaggy?
	Mark them as "invisible" mathematically.

Day 19: Lesson 6.24-6.28  Custom filters, finding edges. Filters are key in CNNs many are applied in the convolutional layer. RGB stack of 3, 2D Matrices.
Thoughts: Padding an image places misinformation into the convolutional layer. Alternatively, leaving it out we lose this line of "sight" which seems a better default.
	
Day 20: Lesson 6.29 Tinkering with CNN on CIFAR data. New model validated & saved at Epoch 28 with small improvement to 76% accuracy. 
	Model seems to have difficulty with that one frog image. Originally classified it as a cat, now a deer.

Day 21: Lesson 6.30-6.31 Pooling Layers and Capsule Networks.

Day 22: Looking into nbextensions for Jupyter notebook, it was magical. Lesson 6.32 Layer visualization. Happy New Year everyone!

Day 23: Detailed notes on Capsule networks and studying Layer visualization.

Day 24: Lesson 6.33-6.36

Day 25: PR to pysyft repo early this a.m.

Day 26: Finished Lesson 6. Lots of great resources so I'll be revisiting this lesson.

Day 27: Today is a skip day. Looking forward to Lesson 7 tomorrow!

Day 28: Lesson 7.1-7.9 Style transfer

Day 29: Took the time to create slack #introduction today. Continuing to read Permanent Record by E. Snowden - half way through!

D30: Off on a tangent today. Enjoying #introductions channel write ups. Thanks to you all for sharing - its not easy for us is it?!?! haha. Today I'm learning about fastAI v2 overview which is a library that overlays PyTorch.

D31: Finished style transfer Lesson 7. Octopus + RubixCubes. 

D32: Lesson 8.1-8.5 LSTM reminds me of Dory (from Finding Dory).

D33: Lesson 8.6-8.13 Learning time series prediction and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).

D34: Lession 8.14-8.18

D35: Today is a skip day.

D36: Lesson 8.15 to the end. Tuning hyper-parameters. 

D37: Lesson9.1-9.7 It is freezing here! Power grid reached new consumption record yesterday and we are in a deep freeze most of this week. -41C Brrrrrrrr  

D38: Lesson 9.8-9.10 Embedding layer as a lookup table.

D39: Today I checked dataset format for medical ai projects. Lesson 9 review.

D40: Busy with soccer tournaments this weekend. Counting today as a skip day.

D41: Completed course today. Hard to celebrate since it feels like I have so much more work to do and learn. On to projects!
